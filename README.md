# Loan Management Application (Python3)

The application is created as a high school project. The application serves the feature to manage monetary loans. The application is written using python3 programming language. The application does not use any database connectivity in order to store the in-app data, instead it stores the data in JSON format files. Thus the python script also requires the json-module for operating on the application data. The application stores its data in a JSON file named __'database.json'__.

## Note

* The application is created to be submitted as a school project, and thus the application is not of that advanced version. Instead the things are kept to be of easy concepts and just the basic python data handling algorithms.

* The _main.py_ file is the main script file that is used to run the application. The application can be started using the command below. Open up the terminal and type this command.
```
python3 main.py
```

* Any errors on the application code can be fixed by you and then be sent to us, we will further verify the updates and approve them if they make the application better.
